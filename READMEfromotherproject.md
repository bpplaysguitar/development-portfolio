## Description
In this project, I refactored code for the purposes of accessibility to the user, and proper organization and smooth work flow for my fellow developers. By adding semantic HTML elements and rearranging the CSS selectors in a way that made more sense and flowed with the layout of the page, I improved the page for both user and my team, including keeping this up to standards of accessibility and keeping my team out of trouble.

Refactoring the CSS helped make it much more well thought out and organized for anyone else who may come along and work on these files at a later time. It also helps me organize my own thoughts about CSS for practice.

I learned how much easier it is to work on files when they have been written with the aim to be as clear and easy to understand as possible. We need to work on projects assuming we won't be the only ones looking at our code later and trying to make sense of it.
